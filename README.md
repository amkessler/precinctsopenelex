The goal of the precinctsopenelex R package is to provide a number of helper functions designed to aid in creating precinct-level election results datasets to match the structure and format used by the [OpenElections](https://github.com/openelections) project.  
  
It is currently under development. (Initial [documentation](https://amkessler.github.io/precinctsopenelex/).)
